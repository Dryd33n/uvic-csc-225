LaTex files for assignments from UVic CSC 225, Data Structures and Algorithms I. 

### [Assignment 1](Assignments/Assignment%201/Assignment1_Solution.pdf) 100%
- Counting Permutations
- Counting Combinations
- Proofs with Combinations
- Counting Combinations (Stars and Bars)

### [Assignment 3](https://github.com/Dryd33n/uvic-csc-225/tree/main/Assignments/Assignment%203/src) 80%
- Design a recursive algorithm to determine if two arrays A and B are oddly equal where oddly equal is defined as, two arrays, A and B, are defined to be oddly equal of one another if at least one of the following two conditions is satisfied:
1. A = B (the arrays have the same elements at each index)
2. If ùíè is divisible by 2, A and B are divided into two sub-arrays of equal size (A is divided into A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub>, B into B<sub>1</sub> and B<sub>2</sub>). Then, at least one of the following conditions is satisfied:
   - (A<sub>1</sub> is oddly equal to B<sub>1</sub>) AND (A<sub>2</sub> is oddly equal to B<sub>2</sub>)
   - (A<sub>1</sub> is oddly equal to B<sub>1</sub>) AND (A<sub>1</sub> is oddly equal to B<sub>2</sub>)
   - (a<sub>2</sub> is oddly equal to B<sub>1</sub>) AND (A<sub>2</sub> is oddly equal to B<sub>2</sub>)

- The goal was too design the algorithm with the least time complexity, the most difficult goal to achieve was having a ùëÇ(ùëõ<sup>2‚àíùúÄ</sup>) where ùúÄ > 0
